Hi,

Yes I know the site looks simple, but that's not my intention at all. Initially I would like to build a **SUPER FANCY** blogging site: cookies, trackings, ads, animations, dozens of aesthetically pleasing buttons that are never clicked, an ultra intelligent AI chat bot siting at the bottom right corner of the window that asks if you need any help whenever your cursor is idle for more than 17 milliseconds, etc. Problem is, I have ZERO knowledge on how to build a website. So, I did the following:

1. Search on YouTube: "How to build a website", spend 1.5 minutes on each video, including 1 minute of watching "Thanks to today's sponsor ...", then found a video introducing a **Svelte** thing.

1. Without knowing how to pronounce it, followed the [offcial tutorial](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction) to make a demo site with some creativity and a pinch of love ‚ù§Ô∏è

1. Ended up in an ugly but functional blog site, vaguely remembered the thing that can make a website beautiful is called "CSS".

1. Search "CSS" on Github randomly and found this: [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css), shamelessly copied the whole CSS file, the site looks much better.

1. The default font looks boring, search "SUPER FANCY FONT" and found this Github Monaspace Handwritten font, which looks nice, then found it is free to use, double nice!

1. Created some test posts -> cannot display -> ‚òπÔ∏è

1. DEBUG, DEBUG, DEBUG

1. Pushed the project to Github and set up Cloudflare pages -> cannot display -> ‚òπÔ∏è

1. DEBUG, DEBUG, DEBUG

1. Fixed (almost) all problems, became lazy and refused to improve. _C'mon, at least it works!_.

That's it, I ended up here, with no cookies, no ads, no ultra intelligent AI chat bot, nothing more than a functional blogging site. But now I can record & share my life without paying a dime to the big tech company (Yes I use Clourflare free tier). I have learned a lot throughout the process and I hope whoever reading the posts can find it helpful.

Cheers ü•Ç,

Isaac Liang

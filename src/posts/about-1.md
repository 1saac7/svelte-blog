Hi,

Yes I know the site looks simple, but that's not my intention at all. Initially I would like to build a **SUPER FANCY** blogging site: cookies, trackings, ads, animations, dozens of aesthetically pleasing buttons that are never clicked, an ultra intelligent AI chat bot siting at the bottom corner asking if you need any help in the most "user-friendly" way, etc. Problem is, I have ZERO knowledge on how to build a website. So, I did the following:

1. Search on YouTube: "How to build a website", spend 1.5 minutes on each video, including 1 minute of watching "Thanks to today's sponsor ...", then found a video introducing a **Svelte** thing.

1. Without knowing how to pronounce it, followed the [offcial tutorial](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction) to make a demo site with some creativity and a pinch of love ❤️

1. Ended up in an ugly but functional blog site, vaguely remembered the thing that can make a website beautiful is called "CSS".

1. Search "CSS" on Github randomly and found this: [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css), shamelessly copied the whole CSS file, the site looks much better.

1. Created some test posts -> cannot display -> 😤

1. DEBUG, DEBUG, DEBUG

1. Pushed the project to Github and set up Cloudflare pages -> cannot display -> 😤

1. DEBUG, DEBUG, DEBUG

1. <s>Fixed (almost) all problems. It works!</s>

1. Throughout the next two weeks, keep finding all kinds of bugs -> 😤

1. DEBUG, DEBUG, DEBUG

1. I hope this time it works 🙏

That's it, I ended up here, with no cookies, no ads, no ultra intelligent AI chat bot, nothing more than a functional blogging site. But now I can record & share my life without paying a dime to the big tech company (Yes I use Cloudflare free tier). I have learned a lot throughout the process and I hope whoever reading the posts can find it helpful.

Technical details of the site is [here](/blog/about-2).

Cheers 🥂,

Isaac Liang
